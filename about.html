    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
      Hi, I'm Alexey Simchenko — a dedicated software developer with a strong
      focus on native Android and React Native. I enjoy building clean,
      efficient, and user-friendly applications that solve real-world problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm comfortable working across both frontend and backend technologies, and
      I'm always exploring new tools, frameworks, and techniques to grow as a
      developer and improve the quality of my work.
    </p>
